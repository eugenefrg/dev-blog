Today I felt like I want to explore around web development. I'm feeling "extra-learny" today, so I tried to scratch that itch. Maybe it's because I may have hit a plateau, since I know for a fact that I have been improving slower. So the effort I'm attempting today is to try and learn as much as I can with Gatsby.

I can see so many benefits from starting and continuing with this project. Learning GatsbyJS is already given. GatsbyJS is a javascript library that's based on ReactJS and GraphQL and those are two things that I'm also working with professionally. I can see that it would be beneficial to use these libraries with a different context, like a newer point of view, just like if we had a look at something on a different angle, it may reveal something that we have not yet seen before. I could also eventually improve in my writing, and hopefully be more fluent and understandable in english, as I am not a native speaker. By also having this project as a continuous one, it would help myself to keep learning more about things not only within Gatsby, React, or GraphQL but maybe even other libraries, or programming languages.

Just as a background, I started this repository a few months ago, May 2022 when I got curious about the library and thought "why not try it out?".
I signed up to https://www.gatsbyjs.com/ where I found that I could create the blog from there.

So I added a site and when I did start the process, it also created the repository in github and it's an already deployed boilerplate. I was able to play around with the thing until I broke it, and I was not able to get it working again, which made me lose interest.

Fast forward today, I am now a more careful man than I was three months ago, and I have properly read the things that must be read. _I still don't know why it was broken though._

Now my plan here in this blog is nothing too special, this is more of a way for me to see the steps I took through my journey as a developer, and hopefully allow me to look back for whatever reason it may be.

I guess a plan exclusively for this blog would be to get a re-design and make it look great. For how I will be using the blog, I'll be writing about what I have been doing to try to push forward the limits of my knowledge.

To you my dear reader and friend, I welcome you to join me in this odyssey to gain knowledge and wisdom in this field. May my experiences also help you better yourself, as they would to me.

And to future Eugene, How are you? I hope you're doing well.

here's some potatoes I guess
